        Touring Artists was created by artists, for artists, with the goal of
        making a simple and stress free alternative for booking performers for
        tour across Australia.

        We understand the challenges of securing the right venue, which is why
        we've built a platform that connects artists with top venues in
        Australia's major cities.

        Whether you're an emerging act or an established artist, Touring Artist
